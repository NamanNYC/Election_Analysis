# Election Audit Analysis
## Overview
The Election Audit initially served the purpose of guiding us through an introduction to Python. The purpose has changed from just a guide through Python to an applicable scenario. The purpose now is now to figure out the turnout of total voters from each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and finally the county with the highest turnout.

## Election Audit Summary
This script can be used for any vote ranging from a simple passing of a law to a largely scaled state election. Both would require appropriate modifications, but this script would be appropriate to be used for any voting event.
